# Final project for the course Algorithms for speech and natural language processing - Master MVA, ENS Paris-Saclay (2021-2022)

This repository contains the work done by Yujin Cho, Loubna Ben Allal, Gabriel Baker and Chlo√© Sekkat for their final 
project in the course ``Algorithms for speech and natural language processing`` at the master MVA, ENS Paris-Saclay. 

For this project, we worked on a tokenization-free encoder for language representation called [CANINE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06874). 
It is the first character-level pre-trained deep encoder that is completely tokenization-free and vocabulary-free. We studied the 
performance of CANINE on several NLP tasks and compare it to other models (similar to BERT).
