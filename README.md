# Final project for the course Algorithms for speech and natural language processing - Master MVA, ENS Paris-Saclay (2021-2022)

This repository contains the work done by Yujin Cho, Loubna Ben Allal, Gabriel Baker and Chlo√© Sekkat for their final 
project in the course ``Algorithms for speech and natural language processing`` at the master MVA, ENS Paris-Saclay. 

For this project, we worked on a tokenization-free encoder for language representation called [CANINE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06874). 
It is the first character-level pre-trained deep encoder that is completely tokenization-free and vocabulary-free. We studied the 
performance of CANINE on several NLP tasks and compare it to other models (similar to BERT).

# Installation 

The code was tested with Python3.8.6

```python
pip install -r requirements
```

Please note that you will need to update manually the versions of ``torch``, ``torchaudio`` and ``torchvision`` depending
on your hardware.


# Structure of the repository

-``notebooks``: the notebooks we used for our experiments. 
- ``source/qa``: source code needed to prepare and train CANINE for Question Answering task (see application in the notebook
``squad_finetuning``)
- ``sh_scripts/qa``: collection of bash scripts to finetune and evaluate models on QA tasks.
